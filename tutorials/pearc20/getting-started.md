## Getting Started

This site and the resulting tutorial is designed to be experienced in 3 ways:
* Standalone tutorial cluster run by the OpenHPC team on which you have a user account
* EventEngine driven tutorial cluster on which you have you are provided a provisioned cluster and have full admin privledges
* An AWS cluster you provision from scratch on your own AWS account following Exercises 1 and 3

### Standalone Tutorial Cluster

As part of PEARC 2020, the OpenHPC cloud working group has provisioned an OpenHPC cluster at AWS. 
This cluster will be available from Monday, July 27th 2020 until Friday, August 7th.

User accounts will be provided to tutorial attendees and they will be used for Exercises 2 and 5.


### EventEngine Tutorial Cluster

Also as part of PEARC 2020, [EventEngine](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/login) hashes will be available upon request.
In order to request a hash, join the [OpenHPC Slack](http://openhpc.community/support/slack/) and request a hash in the PEARC2020 channel.

Once you have the hash, go to [EventEngine](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/login), enter the hash and in a few minutes you will be provided with:
* A terminal in a web browser which is running Cloud9, a Cloud IDE
* A slurm login/management node and two compute nodes, configured as persistent/static compute nodes
* All files needed to customize the existing deployment, or deploy a new static or dynamic SLURM cluster
* All files needed to follow the tutorial and remaining exercises


Hash requests will be accepted after the tutorial until Friday, August 7th. 
Once deployed, your EvenEngine cluster will be available for 48 hours.

### AWS cluster from scratch

The third way to experience this tutorial is to use your own AWS account and follow along with Exercises 1 and 3. 
After finishing these two exercises, you will have your own system that can then be used to do Exercise 5.

FIXME

here is where I capture and document the steps to get a fresh account up to the point of cloud9 ide ready

## Introduction

This page will look like the 2017 and 2019 tutorial.

Brief paragraph introduction and link to google slide deck that Karl presents during the 25 min "advanced intro" section.

Topics that will be hit in tutorial which should be references here via the key concepts mechanism:
* target system arch should have a new slide to talk about the cloud initiatives
* should also compare / contrast to ParallelCluster and point to AWS' tutorial on Friday
* building block repo 
* hierarchical software environment featured in Exercise 2
* intel lmod foo is also discussed and demo'd via the ohpc intel module and lmod-defaults mechanism
* packaging conventions will be used and meta RPMs will be used as part of the demo
* install recipes will be referenced including appendicies for meta packages available
* should talk about getting slack support during the tutorial
* aim to provide similar cloud recipes to support centos/sles and slurm/pbs
* we will not provide AMIs, we will provide packer templates to build your own AMIs (equivalent to the CHROOT concepts for bare metal)
* we will provide cloudformation templates to provision systems (equivalent to warewulf / xcat)

with all of this plus the 2.x changes and perhaps libfabric vs ucx discussions, this is probably too much for 25 mins.

consider adding a 5-10 min slide deck per exercise section as needed and link in a similar way to google slides

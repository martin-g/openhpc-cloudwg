Since its inception as a Linux Foundation project in 2015, OpenHPC
(https:///openhpc.community) has steadily grown to provide a modern, consistent
reference collection of HPC software. Although a primary focus of OpenHPC is to
enable sites deploying new HPC clusters to rapidly get their clusters up and
running, the OpenHPC software repository itself serves as a reliable, portable,
integrated collection of software, libraries, tools and user environment that
can be employed in containers and VMs as well as HPC clusters to develop and
execute HPC applications.  Although the primary focus of OpenHPC remains
enabling the on-premises deployment of new HPC clusters rapidly, the OpenHPC
software repository itself serves as a reliable, portable, integrated collection
of software, libraries, tools and user environment that can be employed in
containers and VMs in the cloud. 

The goal of this tutorial is to help HPC cluster operators, users and
application developers gain a better understanding of OpenHPC, and to develop
confidence in their ability to employ elements of the OpenHPC software
repository to address their needs in flexible ways within HPC clusters as well
as in portable environments including containers on their laptop computers or in
OpenHPC-ready VMs in cloud environments.

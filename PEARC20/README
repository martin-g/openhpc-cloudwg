tutorial-system/

This is the yaml and scripts to build the full system with all capabilities needed to run workloads during the actual tutorial.
This cluster will be hosted in the OpenHPC organizational AWS account.
~40 user accounts should be set up in advance.

The ML workloads will be done with tensorflow containers on CPUs. GPUs get expensive quickly.

- Cluster to SSH into for tutorial on OHPC AWS Org account
- controller
- login + OOD
- compute + OOD + tensorflow CPU container

event-engine/

This is the yaml and scripts to build the event engine based systems for attendees to use after the tutorial for up to 2 weeks.
User comes to our slack and asks for a hash. Hash entered into event engine website and user is popped into a cloud9 IDE.
In user directory are all the yaml files to build a tutorial complete system with packer installed as well.

- Cluster for EventEngine
- pops you into cloud9 + files locally for following along
- you build AMIs with packer + run CF templates
- controller + login + OOD
- compute + OOD + provide a tensorflow CPU container
- user can then use OOD or CLI to run workloads from tutorial

exercises/

These are the systems that we will build and augment throughout the tutorial.

Cluster steps for tutorial:

Exercise 1
- controller + login
- compute

Exercise 3
- extend controller + login with OOD
- extend compute + OOD

Exercise 4
- new compute node with GPU for TF

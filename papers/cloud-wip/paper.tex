\section{Introduction}
Motherhood, meet apple pie.

\subsection{Insallation Overview}
Walk them thru an overview of how to do the installation. What tools are being
used...pointer to working docs.

\subsection{Instance Overview}

Discussion/recommendation on instance types that are likely the most relevant
for HPC use; comment on bursty instances.

\lipsum[4]

\section{Results}
\lipsum[6]
\subsection{Cluster assembly}
\begin{itemize}
\item maybe highlight some meaurements for the time it takes to build the
  cluster at AWS from scratch?
\item highlight time to launch job with dynamic resource manager power on/off
  (ie, how long to launch a job if no nodes are available)
\item resulting final image size to stash if wanting to save?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MPI microbenchmarks}
\begin {itemize}
\item demonstrate reasonable latencies and effective bandwidth with EFA
\item compare mpich/openmpi
\item contrast with distro provided mpi if possible?
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
The authors would like to thank members of the OpenHPC cloud working group and
technical steering committee who have provided guidance and input on efforts to
enable usage of OpenHPC-based builds on cloud resources.

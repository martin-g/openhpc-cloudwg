  With the growing interest in using cloud-based resources in support of
  traditional HPC workloads, there is a need to aggregate development and
  performance libraries from multiple sources for use in dynamic cloud
  environments. This paper highlights the use of OpenHPC, a Linux Foundation
  project combined with provisioning mechanisms available within AWS to provide
  a modular, open-source HPC development enviroment for HPC workloads.  We
  highlight instantation on AWS using aarch64 instances and the openSUSE Leap
  distribution using the SLURM resource manager to provide a familiar HPC
  operating environment running the cloud that can support multi user-tenancy.
  MPI micro-benchmarks are carried out using OpenHPC's latest build
  configurations supporting the AWS elastic fabric adapter.
